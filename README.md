We can ensure functionality and security by making sure we don't leave gaps in our code, or take shortcuts in order to deliver on promises. We can do things like make tests to make sure our code delivers on benchmarks we want to hit.

Ideally we aren't doing much interpreting. We want to be sure to write down everything that the customer wants out of their program and our time working with them. Make sure you ask good questions as they are appropriate, and make tests in order to deliver on those expectations.

Approaching design is pretty simple. Make sure the planning phase doesn't allow for a lack of clarity. You want to make sure that the process lacks a sense of vagueness. Make sure you create tests that are void of bias, and make sure the outlines you create carry the process.
